/*
    Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.
 

    Example 1:

    Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
    Example 2:

    Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
    Output: true
    Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.
